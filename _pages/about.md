Welcome to my website!

I am a Pre-Doctoral Fellow in Management at HEC Paris, working with [Prof. Federica de Stefano](https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/destefano-federica). I obtained my Master in Economics degree from SciencesPo Paris in 2022. 

One strand of my research interests is how firms gain competitive advantages from human capital management, for example by redeploying employees or outsourcing tasks. Another strand focuses on job search, discrimination and wage gaps on the labor market, particularly topics related to migration and gender.
