Welcome to my website!

I am a Pre-Doctoral fellow in Management at HEC Paris, working with Prof. [Federica de Stefano]("https://www.hec.edu/en/faculty-research/faculty-directory/faculty-member/destefano-federica"). I obtained my Master in Economics degree at SciencesPo Paris in 2022. 

My research interest are strategic human capital and labor economics. One strand of my research interest is how firms achieve competitive advantages from human capital management. Another strand explores the discrimination and social consequences of job change in the labor market.
